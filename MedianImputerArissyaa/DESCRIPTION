Authors@R: NUR ARISSYA AINA BT ZAIHAM

Description: The MedianImputer package is designed to simplify the handling of missing data in numeric datasets by providing an easy-to-use function for 
median imputation. This package identifies missing values (NA) in numeric columns of a given dataset and replaces them with the median value of the respective
column, ensuring robust imputation even in the presence of outliers. By automating this process, MedianImputer helps maintain data integrity and supports
preprocessing tasks in data analysis and machine learning workflows.
